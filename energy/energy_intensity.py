# Need to come up with a way to estimate energy use by facility for
# industrial FRS facilities.
#
# Given the additional disclosure requirements imposed by IRS for CBP,
# use ZBP to get establishment counts by 6-digit NAICS code.
# Then, use methods from IET to apportion non-manufacturing energy use.
# For manufacturing, apportion Census Region MECS (use iterative balancing method; 
# value of shipments instead of employee count. See county-level data for method)
